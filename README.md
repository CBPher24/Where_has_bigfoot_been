## WHERE HAS BIGFOOT BEEN?

Bigfoot is said to be an ape-like creature who roams around the forests of North America. Resembling a cross between a gorilla and a human, many have theorized that they are something of a “missing link” in evolution. 

According to Bigfoot Field Researcher Organization (BFRO), there have been over 10,000 reported Bigfoot sightings in the continental United States. About one-third of all claims of Bigfoot sightings are located in the Pacific Northwest, with the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of North America. 

BFRO has collected and set a dataset about bigfoot sightings throughout North America. 

This project will create an application that shows various critical and important visualizations and statistics about sasquatch sightings.

## METHODS FOR ANALYSIS:

Utilized the datasets found in BFRO, DataWorld, Kaggle.

The project runs using a Python "Flak" App, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Powered by a dataset with over 3,500 records

Using a Mongo Database

Our chosen track: A Combination of Webscraping and Leaflet

A new JS library: 

## FINAL FINDINGS:
